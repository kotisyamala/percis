            A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is created and managed
            through the use of advanced encryption techniques known as
            cryptography. Cryptocurrency made the leap from being an academic
            concept to (virtual) reality with the creation of Bitcoin in 2009.1﻿
            While Bitcoin attracted a growing following in subsequent years, it
            captured significant investor and media attention in April 2013 when
            it peaked at a record $266 per bitcoin after surging 10-fold in the
            preceding two months. Bitcoin sported a market value of over $2
            billion at its peak, but a 50% plunge shortly thereafter sparked a
            raging debate about the future of cryptocurrencies in general and
            Bitcoin in particular.2﻿ So, will these alternative currencies
            eventually supplant conventional currencies and become as ubiquitous
            as dollars and euros someday? Or are cryptocurrencies a passing fad
            that will flame out before long? The answer lies with Bitcoin.
          </p>

          <b>The Future of Cryptocurrency </b>
          <p>
            Some economic analysts predict a big change in crypto is forthcoming
            as institutional money enters the market.3﻿ Moreover, there is the
            possibility that crypto will be floated on the Nasdaq, which would
            further add credibility to blockchain and its uses as an alternative
            to conventional currencies.4﻿ Some predict that all that crypto
            needs is a verified exchange traded fund (ETF).5﻿ An ETF would
            definitely make it easier for people to invest in Bitcoin, but there
            still needs to be the demand to want to invest in crypto, which
            might not automatically be generated with a fund.

          <b>Understanding Bitcoin</b>
          <p>
            Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that uses peer-to-peer
            technology, which enables all functions such as currency issuance,
            transaction processing and verification to be carried out
            collectively by the network.6﻿ While this decentralization renders
            Bitcoin free from government manipulation or interference, the
            flipside is that there is no central authority to ensure that things
            run smoothly or to back the value of a Bitcoin. Bitcoins are created
            digitally through a “mining” process that requires powerful
            computers to solve complex algorithms and crunch numbers. They are
            currently created at the rate of 25 Bitcoins every 10 minutes and
            will be capped at 21 million, a level that is expected to be reached
            in 2140.7
          </p>

          <p>
            These characteristics make Bitcoin fundamentally different from a
            fiat currency, which is backed by the full faith and credit of its
            government. Fiat currency issuance is a highly centralized activity
            supervised by a nation’s central bank. While the bank regulates the
            amount of currency issued in accordance with its monetary policy
            objectives, there is theoretically no upper limit to the amount of
            such currency issuance. In addition, local currency deposits are
            generally insured against bank failures by a government body.
            Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no such support mechanisms. The
            value of a Bitcoin is wholly dependent on what investors are willing
            to pay for it at a point in time. As well, if a Bitcoin exchange
            folds up, clients with Bitcoin balances have no recourse to get them
            back.
          </p>

          <b>Bitcoin Future Outlook</b>
          <p>
            The future outlook for bitcoin is the subject of much debate. While
            the financial media is proliferated by so-called crypto-evangelists,
            Harvard University Professor of Economics and Public Policy Kenneth
            Rogoff suggests that the “overwhelming sentiment” among crypto
            advocates is that the total “market capitalisation of
            cryptocurrencies could explode over the next five years, rising to
            $5-10 [trillion].”8
          </p>

          <p>
            The historic volatility of the asset class is “no reason to panic,”
            he says. Still, he tempered his optimism and that of the “crypto
            evangelist” view of Bitcoin as digital gold, calling it “nutty,”
            stating its long-term value is “more likely to be $100 than
            $100,000.”8
          </p>

          <p>
            Rogoff argues that unlike physical gold, Bitcoin’s use is limited to
            transactions, which makes it more vulnerable to a bubble-like
            collapse. Additionally, the cryptocurrency’s energy-intensive
            verification process is “vastly less efficient” than systems that
            rely on “a trusted central authority like a central bank.”8
          </p>

          <b>Increasing Scrutiny</b>
          <p>
            Bitcoin’s main benefits of decentralization and transaction
            anonymity have also made it a favored currency for a host of illegal
            activities including money laundering, drug peddling, smuggling and
            weapons procurement. This has attracted the attention of powerful
            regulatory and other government agencies such as the Financial
            Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the SEC, and even the FBI and
            Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In March 2013, FinCEN issued
            rules that defined virtual currency exchanges and administrators as
            money service businesses, bringing them within the ambit of
            government regulation.9﻿ In May that year, the DHS froze an account
            of Mt. Gox – the largest Bitcoin exchange – that was held at Wells
            Fargo, alleging that it broke anti-money laundering laws.10﻿ 11﻿ And
            in August, New York’s Department of Financial Services issued
            subpoenas to 22 emerging payment companies, many of which handled
            Bitcoin, asking about their measures to prevent money laundering and
            ensure consumer protection.12
          </p>

          <b>Alternatives to Bitcoin</b>
          <p>
            Despite its recent issues, Bitcoin’s success and growing visibility
            since its launch has resulted in a number of companies unveiling
            alternative cryptocurrencies, such as:
          </p>

          <p>
            Litecoin – Litecoin is regarded as Bitcoin's leading rival at
            present, and it is designed for processing smaller transactions
            faster. It was founded in October 2011 as "a coin that is silver to
            Bitcoin’s gold,” according to founder Charles Lee.13﻿ Unlike the
            heavy computer horsepower required for Bitcoin mining, Litecoins can
            be mined by a normal desktop computer. Litecoin’s maximum limit is
            84 million – four times Bitcoin’s 21-million limit – and it has a
            transaction processing time of about 2.5 minutes, about one-fourth
            that of Bitcoin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ripple – Ripple was launched by OpenCoin, a company founded by
            technology entrepreneur Chris Larsen in 2012. Like Bitcoin, Ripple
            is both a currency and a payment system. The currency component is
            XRP, which has a mathematical foundation like Bitcoin. The payment
            mechanism enables the transfer of funds in any currency to another
            user on the Ripple network within seconds, in contrast to Bitcoin
            transactions, which can take as long as 10 minutes to confirm. is
            backed by a physical currency, the Canadian dollar.
          </p>
          <p>
            MintChip – Unlike most cryptocurrencies, MintChip is actually the
            creation of a government institution, specifically the Royal
            Canadian Mint. MintChip is a smartcard that holds electronic value
            and can transfer it securely from one chip to another. Like Bitcoin,
            MintChip does not need personal identification; unlike Bitcoin, it
            is backed by a physical currency, the Canadian dollar.
          </p>
          <b>The Future</b>
          <p>
            Some of the limitations that cryptocurrencies presently face – such
            as the fact that one’s digital fortune can be erased by a computer
            crash, or that a virtual vault may be ransacked by a hacker – may be
            overcome in time through technological advances. What will be harder
            to surmount is the basic paradox that bedevils cryptocurrencies –
            the more popular they become, the more regulation and government
            scrutiny they are likely to attract, which erodes the fundamental
            premise for their existence. most people, except for the
            technologically adept.
          </p>

          <p>
            While the number of merchants who accept cryptocurrencies has
            steadily increased, they are still very much in the minority. For
            cryptocurrencies to become more widely used, they have to first gain
            widespread acceptance among consumers. However, their relative
            complexity compared to conventional currencies will likely deter
            most people, except for the technologically adept.
          </p>

          <b>Should You Invest in Cryptocurrencies?</b>
          <p>
            If you are considering investing in cryptocurrencies, it may be best
            to treat your “investment” in the same way you would treat any other
            highly speculative venture. In other words, recognize that you run
            the risk of losing most of your investment, if not all of it. As
            stated earlier, a cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value apart from
            what a buyer is willing to pay for it at a point in time. This makes
            it very susceptible to huge price swings, which in turn increases
            the risk of loss for an investor. Bitcoin, for example, plunged from
            $260 to about $130 within a six-hour period on April 11, 2013.18﻿ If
            you cannot stomach that kind of volatility, look elsewhere for
            investments that are better suited to you. While opinion continues
            to be deeply divided about the merits of Bitcoin as an investment –
            supporters point to its limited supply and growing usage as value
            drivers, while detractors see it as just another speculative bubble
            – this is one debate that a conservative investor would do well to
            avoid.
          </p>

          <b>Conclusion</b>
          <p>
            The emergence of Bitcoin has sparked a debate about its future and
            that of other cryptocurrencies. Despite Bitcoin’s recent issues, its
            success since its 2009 launch has inspired the creation of
            alternative cryptocurrencies such as Etherium, Litecoin, and Ripple.
            A cryptocurrency that aspires to become part of the mainstream
            financial system would have to satisfy very divergent criteria.
            While that possibility looks remote, there is little doubt that
            Bitcoin’s success or failure in dealing with the challenges it faces
            may determine the fortunes of other cryptocurrencies in the years
            ahead.
